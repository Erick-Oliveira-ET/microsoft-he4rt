# Microsoft He4rt challenge
He4rt Developers, a brazilian group sponsered by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft), created a challenge to inpire and give an oportunity for developers to use Microsoft's services freely. To motivate programmers to participate and use this oportunity, they made a challenge: develop any kind of application as long as it uses [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/) Microsoft's authentication system.

For my app, I initially thought in make an agenda viewer but I saw someone saying that there was an Face Recognition API in this development package offered and AI hits different. So, that's what I did: a face recognition app that takes a URL of an image and it returns the attributes of the faces in the image. 

The face recognition API was really simple to use and the documentation was really helpfull. However, the authentication part was tough, mainly because I chose to make it using just the front-end in React and the documentation wasn't really helpful because a lot of things written in it is outdated and is really hard to tell the old and the new version a part. 

In general, was a really fun experience. I've never had to make a project in so short time, and 36 hours was really short mostly because of the strugle with Graph. But in the end I sure learned a lot.
